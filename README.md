# Responsive Website to Emulate Facebook

A responsive website created using <b>Bootstrap 3</b>.

Data is retrieved in the PHP file using the <i>FB PHP SDK</i>, and a consolidated JSON is sent back to the client using <b>AJAX</b>. The client html file processes this JSON and displays proper tables and lists using dynamic views created with <b>AngularJS </b>. 

All items can be marked as favorites which are stored using the <b>HTML5 LocalStorage</b> component.

I've also made use of the <i>Navigator object</i> and geolocation features when displaying results for "Places" so that the nearest results come on top.

<i>FB JavaScript SDK</i> is used to create "post" functionality which can be used to post an entire profile with the website link to Facebook.

Responsive design was tested on laptops, tablets and mobile phones.
